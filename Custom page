In Prestashop we can create a new page using the CMS. This can solve our needs in some point but it can be frustrating due to the limitations they have.
For this ocassions use a module it can be unnecessary, we just want to add a new page with our CSS and/or our custom HTML in the main structure. 
We can do it manually as you will see in the next lines:

1. Create a new controller for this new page: we will name it as newPageController and it will contain:
  <?php
    class newPageControllerCore extends FrontController
    {
      public $php_self = 'newPage';

      public function initContent()
      {
      $this->context->smarty->assign(
        array(
          'variableSmarty1' => 'We can have many variables as we want',
         )
      );

      parent::initContent();
      $this->setTemplate('newPage');
      }
    }
  >
  
  
2. We will have a tpl for this new page (newpage.tpl)
  {extends file='page.tpl'}
  {block name='page_title'}
    <span class="sitemap-title">{l s='newPage' d='Shop.Theme'}</span>
  {/block}
  {block name='page_content_container'}
     <section>
     {$variableSmarty1}
    </section>
  {/block}
  
  Finally we add the php in /controllers/front and the tpl to /themes/yourTheme/templates
